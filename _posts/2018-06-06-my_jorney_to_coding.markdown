I am originally from Sao Paulo Brazil. When I was in college, I studied some basics of languages like C++, Visual Basic and the late COBOL. I enjoyed it and even considered changing my course from Electric Engineering to Computing Science. 

After graduation, I worked for a few various companies in Brazil in the finance and construction industries. I even started up my own online e-commerce company based in South America which started me back working with computers. 

Another factor that attracted me to coding is that I like languages. I have a natural knack for learning them. 
Besides English and Portuguese, I also speak Spanish, German and French.  So learning the language of coding was something that clicked with me. 

I came to the United States several years ago.  I was working as a layout engineer in construction. I worked on some incredible buildings in the New York City. (It is still fun to see the structures I helped to create.)  
But I was craving a new challenge and started searching for something new. 
I rediscovered my interest in coding with a few free online college courses I was playing with from M.I.T. Then through further searching and a tip from a friend who attended the Flatiron school I applied for the full stack web development course and the rest is historyâ€¦
